                As we approach the next 5 - 10 years, I don't think there will be extreme and drastic changes in web design, but there will definetly be some changes that we will affect the way we experience the web. I believe that as technology progresses, designers will focus more on and consider the usability and acessibility of web design. User experience will be key in order for web designers/companies to attract audiences and keep a loyal following (Snapchat and Instagram are constantly changing their design to make it easier for people to use their app). In addition to this, audiences are attracted to dynamic, interactive pages rather than static ones. More and more people rely on their smartphones nowadays to recieve information and communicate with each other and because of this, many web designs will be modified for mobile devices. Innovation and technological advancements have wired humans to be attracted to convenience. I feel that this will be reflected both functionally and aeesthetically. From carrying an iPod AND a phone 10 years ago, we have now merged both devices into one. I believe that web designers will merge functionality and turn to minimalism in terms of aesthetics to match its purpose and to make designs less complicated. Instead of websites, a lot of information will be displayed in apps instead. For example, instead of creating personal blogs, famous celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian have released apps to keep their fans updated about their life. Finally, I believe the introduction of VR has and will greatly affect the future of web design because as technological advancements increase, humans are attracted to the incorporation of technology and reality.
