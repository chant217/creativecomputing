                 Question: How does changing the typography of an iconic logotype such as Google, affect the way people think of the company, especially when drastic changes are being made?

                Most companies in their lifespan will go through rebranding for many reasons similar to how Google did. Changing their logo from serif to sans serif can help indicate that google has evolved, and is modern. Rebranding can help companies shift to new identities and show a sort of growth or evolution. Earlier this year, Uber rebranded and changed their iconic logo. Their new font and logo aims to evoke safety and accessibility, something that the company has been trying to improve for years. The identity of a company as a whole can shift with just a slight change in how they visually present themselves.
